<p> I have been very fortunate to be able to travel to various places in my lifetime.  Travel is one of my favorite things to do.
I love gaining a new perspective of the world, and experiencing new cultures.</p>

<br><p>Last year I was able to travel in a school group to San Francisco in November, which was amazing.  In April, I got to travel to England, and then take a ferry
to explore Normandie France, as well as Paris.  We then took a train to Amsterdam which was super awesome and such a vibrant city.  Below are a few pictures
from the Europe trip.</p>
